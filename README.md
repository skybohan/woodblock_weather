# woodblock_weather
Japanese woodblock themed weather display for PyPortal

PyPortal project based off of the weather display code by John Park

This version uses data from [Dark Sky API](https://www.darksky.net), the displayed images are generated using images from
the Library of Congress, and a font from Google Fonts.

Requires the same dependent libraries as called for in the adafruit project.
